>>First initialize the git using the command : $git init

>>The files cannot be added without staging so the files
  need to be staged using the command : $git add filename.txt

         local files >>staging area >> repository
           :................................:

>>Then check whether the file is staged or not by using 
  command : $git status 
  Note: You need to stage again if edit the file  

>>Now we have to add the stagged file into repo by using 
  command : $git commit -m "your message here" 
  (note first time you might get an error )

  To view the commit history : $git log
  To view commit history in 1 line : $git log --onelline
  To checkout the unedited file after u commited: 
  $git checkout 29fe8 ("thats the hash value")
  to go back after checkout : $get checkout master

  Then we add the origin using command : 
  $git remote add origin https://github.com/arjit86/python_basics.git
  (ur url)
  
  Push our code to github
  $git push origin master 
  Then add the username and password 

>>So config ur email and username using the command : 
  $git  config --global user.email "youremail@gmail.com"
  $git config --global user.name"your username"

>>download the file already uploaded on repo 
  git clone https://github.com/arjit86/python_basics.git
  (clone url)
  
>>To add two files for staging 
  git add .
  git diff --staged
